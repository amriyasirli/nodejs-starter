# Backend Project with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Sequelize

This is a backend project built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Sequelize. It serves as the foundation for building robust RESTful APIs, complete with database interaction using Sequelize ORM for easy communication with a relational database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side applications
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- **Sequelize**: Promise-based ORM for Node.js that supports multiple SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL)
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`
- **Nodemon**: Tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes in the directory are detected

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
